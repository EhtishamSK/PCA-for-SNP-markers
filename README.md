This R script performs a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on genomic data processed with PLINK. It starts by setting the working directory and ensuring PLINK is properly installed. The script then converts the provided PED/MAP files into binary format using PLINK and generates a pairwise distance matrix. PCA is conducted on the distance matrix using classical multidimensional scaling (cmdscale), extracting the first five principal components. The results are visualized in a 2D scatter plot of the first two principal components, with points colored by family ID. Finally, the PCA plot is saved as a high-resolution PNG image. This script is useful for visualizing genetic variation and identifying population structure in association mapping studies.
